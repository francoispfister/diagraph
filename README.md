DSML (Domain Specific Modeling Languages) are an alternative to general purpose modeling languages (e.g. UML or SysML) for describing models with concepts and relations specific to a domain. DSML design is often based on Ecore meta-models, which follow the class-relation paradigm and also require defining a concrete syntax which can be either graphical or textual. In this demo, we focus on graphical concrete syntax, and we introduce an approach and a tool (Diagraph) to assist the design of a graphical DSML. The main points are: non-intrusive annotations of the meta-model to identify nodes, edges, nesting structures and other graphical information; immediate validation of meta-models by immediate generation of an EMF-GMF instance editor supporting multi-diagramming. Diagraph plays the role of an extension to Ecore, and is based on a pattern recognition principle in order to infer most of the concrete syntax.
